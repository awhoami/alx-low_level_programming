"A low-level language is a kind of programming language that has fundamental commands that a computer can understand. Low-level code is frequently cryptic and not legible by humans, in contrast to high-level languages used by software developers. Assembly language and machine language are two examples of low-level programming languages1.

Low-level languages offer little to no abstraction from the architecture of a computer's instruction set, which means that its commands or functions correspond structurally closely to those of the processor. Low-level languages are referred regarded as "close to the hardware" because of the low level of abstraction between them and machine language.
